        <h2>Update April 2021</h2>
            <p>Major renovation has been paused due to pandemic restrictions and concern for potential financial impacts to our city budget.
<br><br>
In 2017, the Cache County School District transferred the buildings and land associated with Park Elementary School (90 S 100 W) to Richmond City. With that acquisition, plans are underway as to how the building will be used. The city offices will be moved to the Park building (now called the Park Community Center) but all else is to be decided.
<br><br>
The Park Renovation Committee was formed in October 2017. Members meet as needed to discuss proposals on use of the Park building, the city building at 6 W Main, and the library/Carnegie building at 38 W Main. Renovations will be made to the Park building in phases. The bulk of the first phase is being funded by the sale of the house the city owned just north of the current city office.
<br><br>
If you have suggestions for what should be done with Park, the current city office building, and the library, please contact one of the committee members or email the committee at ParkRenovation@richmondutah.org.
<br><br>
We will have an open house at Black & White Days (May 19, 2018) with more information and opportunities for you to share your ideas. Meanwhile, you can check out the presentation from the State of the City address for more details.</p>
